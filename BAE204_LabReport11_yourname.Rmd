# Fit first order kinetics to nitrate removal in a wetland

I was given a first file ("infreq_Exp06_Rep2_U0.csv") of nitrate concentration decrease over time in a mesocosm experiment. First I plotted the nitrate concentration decrease as a function of time expressed in days.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
data<-read.csv(file="infreq_Exp06_Rep2_U0.csv",header = TRUE) #Reads file into table format

```
